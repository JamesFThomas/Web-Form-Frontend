# Isekai Quest Frontend

**Isekai Quest** is a single-player, turn-based fantasy adventure game that evokes the feel of retro RPGs. Players create a custom character, choose from a diverse cast of pixel-art avatars, and explore a nostalgic UI inspired by classic quest boards and fantasy towns.

This repository contains the frontend for Isekai Quest, built with **Next.js 15** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The project emphasizes component-driven architecture, immersive design, and a strong visual identity centered around dark-skinned fantasy characters.

## 🧙🏿‍♂️ About the Project

Isekai Quest is more than a portfolio piece — it's an evolving personal project that lets me experiment with game-inspired UI, client-server architecture, and responsive design. Built from scratch after sunsetting an older codebase, it's designed to reflect my current approach to frontend development and visual storytelling.

Happy coding, y’all! 👨🏿‍💻
