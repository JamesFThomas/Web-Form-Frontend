# Web Form Frontend

Web Form Frontend is a Next.js 15 project to display and manipulate API data.

## Description

This project utilizes Next.js 15, Fetch, React Table, React Hook Forms, and MUI styled components to create an application that allows users to view, manipulate, and persist submitted form data.

## Purpose

I worked on a finTech application for almost 3 years and before it went live the project was halted so I was never able to share the things I learned and built during that period with the world. My main reason for building this application is to be an example of the work I completed during that time and showcase my understanding as well as abilities regarding frontend design, form creation, data collection/presentation, and data persistence.

The second reason for building this application was to act as a companion for the C# API I built to further my skills as a full stack developer. The Web Form Frontend project is designed to work with the Web Form API project, and without both you will not be able to visualize any data.

### Features

Each page or component performs a different http request

GET - all forms
GET - form by id
GET - all completed forms
PUT - update form by id#
POST - add new form
DELETE - remove form by id#

### Tests

he component tests for this application were created using the React Testing Library && Jest dependencies
